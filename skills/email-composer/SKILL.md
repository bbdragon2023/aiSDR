# Email Composer Skill

This skill guides the creation of effective, personalized sales outreach emails.

## Core Principles

### 1. Personalization is Non-Negotiable
Every email must contain at least one specific, researched detail about:
- The prospect personally
- Their company
- Their current situation or challenges

Generic emails get ignored. Personalized emails get responses.

### 2. Value First, Pitch Second
Lead with insight or value, not product features. The prospect should learn something or feel understood before any ask.

### 3. Brevity Wins
- Subject lines: 3-7 words
- Body: 50-125 words
- One clear CTA
- Mobile-friendly formatting

### 4. Conversational, Not Corporate
Write like a helpful human, not a marketing brochure. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, and formal stiffness.

## Email Structure

### Subject Line
- Personalized reference OR curiosity gap
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, ACT NOW, etc.)
- Test: Would you open this?

**Good examples:**
- "Quick question about [their initiative]"
- "Saw your post on [topic]"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Idea for [their company]"

**Bad examples:**
- "Touching base"
- "Quick sync?"
- "Partnership opportunity"
- "Introduction"

### Opening Line
The first sentence must be about THEM, not you. Reference:
- Something they did (post, talk, achievement)
- Something about their company (news, growth)
- A specific challenge they likely face
- A mutual connection

**Good examples:**
- "Congrats on the Series B - scaling a team from 50 to 200 is no small feat."
- "Your post about [topic] really resonated - we're seeing the same pattern with [x]."
- "I noticed [Company] just expanded into [market]. That usually creates [challenge]."

**Bad examples:**
- "I hope this email finds you well."
- "My name is [x] and I work at [y]."
- "I'm reaching out because..."

### Value Proposition
One concise statement of what you offer and why it matters to them specifically.

**Formula:** We help [target audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism].

**Example:** "We help engineering teams at fast-growing startups ship 40% faster by automating their deployment pipeline."

### Social Proof (Optional)
Brief mention of relevant customer or result. Only include if directly relevant.

**Example:** "Companies like [Similar Company] use us to [specific outcome]."

### Call to Action
One clear, low-friction ask. Make it easy to say yes.

**Good CTAs:**
- "Worth a 15-minute call to explore?"
- "Open to a quick chat this week?"
- "Mind if I send over a short case study?"
- "Would it make sense to connect you with our team?"

**Bad CTAs:**
- "Let me know your thoughts."
- "Please review the attached materials and schedule time."
- Multiple asks in one email

### Signature
- Name
- Title
- Company
- One contact method (phone or calendar link)

Keep it simple. No quotes, no banners, no lengthy disclaimers.

## Email Templates

### Cold Outreach - Research-Based

```
Subject: [Personalization hook]

Hi [First Name],

[Personalized opening - 1 sentence about them/their company]

[Brief value prop - what you do and why it matters to them]

[Optional: Quick proof point]

[Single CTA - question format]

[Signature]
```

### Follow-Up #1 (3-4 days after initial)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to bump this up in your inbox.

[Add one new piece of value - insight, resource, or angle]

[Restate CTA in different words]

[Signature]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (5-7 days after follow-up #1)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

[First Name],

I know [common challenge in their role] is probably keeping you busy.

Quick question: [Specific, easy-to-answer question about their situation]

[Signature]
```

### Breakup Email (Final follow-up)

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back - totally understand you're busy.

I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't follow up again. But if [topic] becomes a priority, I'm here.

Wishing you continued success with [specific initiative or goal].

[Signature]
```

## Personalization Levels

### Level 1: Basic (Minimum acceptable)
- First name
- Company name
- Industry-specific language

### Level 2: Standard (Good)
- Reference to company news or situation
- Role-specific challenges
- Relevant social proof

### Level 3: Deep (Best)
- Reference to their content (post, article, talk)
- Specific insight about their team/product
- Mutual connection or shared experience
- Timing trigger (funding, hiring, launch)

## Quality Checklist

Before sending, verify:

- [ ] Subject line is personalized and compelling
- [ ] Opening line is about them, not you
- [ ] Email is under 125 words
- [ ] Value prop is clear and relevant
- [ ] CTA is single and low-friction
- [ ] No spelling/grammar errors
- [ ] Formatting is mobile-friendly
- [ ] Tone matches their company culture

## Common Mistakes

1. **The essay** - Too long, too much information
2. **The template smell** - Obviously mass-sent
3. **The pitch slap** - Product features before rapport
4. **The vague ask** - Unclear what you want them to do
5. **The humble brag** - Excessive company/product talk
6. **The pressure close** - Urgency without value
7. **The follow-up flood** - Too many emails too fast
